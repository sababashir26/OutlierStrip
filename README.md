# OutlierStrip
OutlierStrip is a MATLAB tool designed to empower researchers and data analysts working with spectral data to efficiently identify and remove outliers. By offering an interactive graphical user interface (GUI), OutlierStrip simplifies the process of refining spectral datasets, ensuring cleaner data for further analysis or modeling tasks.
Core Features:

Custom Variable Filtering: Utilize bespoke prefix and suffix criteria to sift through extensive datasets, honing in on the spectra of interest with unparalleled ease.
Dynamic Data Visualization: Leverage an intuitive graphical interface to inspect and interact with spectral data in real time, making outlier identification not just accurate but visually intuitive.
Manual Outlier Exclusion: Empower users to directly select and excise anomalous spectra through a few clicks, ensuring datasets are refined with precision.
Smart Orientation Adjustment: Automatically realigns data based on user-defined wavenumber dimensions, guaranteeing consistent and accurate spectral representation.
Quick Start Guide:

Download the OutlierStrip repository to your local machine.
Launch MATLAB and navigate to OutlierStrip's folder.
Execute OutlierStrip from the MATLAB command line.
Filter Variables by Prefixes/Suffixes:
Prompt: Upon launching OutlierStrip, you'll be asked whether you want to filter variables by prefixes, suffixes, or both. This step is crucial for narrowing down the list of variables (spectral datasets) you wish to analyze, especially in environments with numerous datasets.
Details:
Prefixes: Enter a comma-separated list of prefixes. Only variables starting with these prefixes will be considered.
Suffixes: Enter a comma-separated list of suffixes. The tool will filter in variables ending with these suffixes.
Both: If you choose both, you'll provide both prefixes and suffixes, allowing for highly specific variable filtering.
2. Enter the Expected Dimension for Wavenumbers:
Prompt: After variable selection, you'll input the expected dimension (e.g., 660) that represents the number of wavenumbers. This information is vital for correctly aligning the spectral data for analysis.
Details:
This dimension helps OutlierStrip understand the data structure, ensuring that spectra are plotted with wavenumbers along the x-axis. It's a critical step for datasets where the orientation isn't standardized.

Ideal Use Cases:

Analytical Data Preparation: Prime your spectral data for high-stakes analysis or modeling, ensuring your findings rest on a foundation of quality and reliability.
Educational Demonstrations: Illuminate the critical role of data cleanliness in spectroscopic studies, providing a hands-on tool for instructional purposes.
Innovative R&D Projects: Accelerate the preprocessing of experimental data, facilitating quicker iterations and sharper insights in research endeavors.
